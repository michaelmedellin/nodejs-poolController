/************************************************************************
 * Nixie:  Nixie is a control panel that controls devices as a master. It
 * can extend an existing *Touch or Center control panel.  Or it can run
 * standalone as a master controller.  The NixieControlPanel will always
 * be instantiated to control equipment when that equipment is not
 * supported or controlled by a traditional OCP.  However, if a traditional
 * OCP exists, it will be subordinate to that OCP in regard to controlling
 * pool bodies.
 * 
 * Equipment: Equipment identified as ncp (Nixie Control Panel) will be
 * managed by the Nixie controller.  It works hand-in-glove with the REM
 * (Relay Equipment Manager) to provide low level hardware support.
 * 
 * RS485: RS485 occurs directly within nixie through the standard RS485
 * bus identified for njspc and does not route through REM.  This is an
 * important distinction to provide robust hardware level communication.
 * Items Controlled on this channel include: Pumps, Chlorinators, and
 * IntelliChem controllers.  When and if IntelliValve functions become
 * available these too will be performed through the njspc RS485 bus.
 * 
 * Configuration and State Management:
 * Nixie uses the underlying njspc configuration structures.  The intent
 * is not to replace these rather the intention is to extend them with
 * low level control.  For this reason, only when a Nixie is the only
 * master controller on the pool do commands get routed through NixieBoard.
 * this mode is identified at startup. When a particular piece of equipment 
 * is identified to be controlled by Nixie as a master then the command 
 * will eventually be marshalled to the NixieControlPanel.  Any connected
 * OCP will get first crack at it.
 * 
 * LifeCycle: The Nixie controller does not persist data outside of
 * the PoolConfig.json and PoolState.json files.  It is initialized
 * at startup and torn down when the application is stopped.
